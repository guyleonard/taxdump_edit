# Taxdump Edit

## Why?
The taxdump files from NCBI, along with the 'nr' database, are often used in meta -genomics and -transcriptomics software to inform taxonomic identification of reads, contigs and ORFs. However, if you are working with organisms that have little to no representation in the NCBI databases then you may find yourself a bit stuck.

Many researchers in this situation will have custom databases of genomic/transcriptomic data and want to use it, but may still find their organism(s) unavailable within the NCBI taxonomy DB. If your organism does not have a valid TaxID in NCBI then you are unable to use many of the software packages that rely on 'taxdump' to extract taxonomic lineage and naming information with your custom DBs.

## What?
This tool will allow you to modify the 'taxdump' (appending new data to names.dmp and nodes.dmp) files from NCBI, to temporarily include your organisms - until they find represenration of their own in the NCBI taxonomy lineage.

## How?
The script will automatically find the largest taxonomic ID in nodes.dmp and increment from that point (with a 10^length-1 addition) and assign it to your new taxa. This large addition is to avoid future conflicts with taxdump updates. Once added, you can then run *makeblastdb* with the '-taxid' option and your newly assigned TaxID.

```
## Example
### New 'Species'
Adding a new 'species' lineage, for example, MAST-4A. We know by looking at the NCBI Taxonomy that there is already a group for "Stramenopiles MAST-4" at TaxID:[1735725](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=1735725) with a lineage of "cellular organisms; Eukaryota; Stramenopiles; unclassified stramenopiles". This is correct for our new organism, so we need to note down the TaxID of '1735725'. Then use the script as below, this assumes some default options which have been noted in the [Usage](https://github.com/guyleonard/taxdump_edit/blob/master/README.md#usage) section above:

    taxdump_edit.pl -names names.dmp -nodes nodes.dmp -taxa MAST-4A -parent 1735725 -rank species -division 11
We have given the script the location of both names.dmp and nodes.dmp, along with the new taxa name of 'MAST-4A'. We are saying that the parental lineage is TaxID:1735725 and that the rank of the organism is 'species'. The division number is from the [Division](https://github.com/guyleonard/taxdump_edit/blob/master/README.md#divisions) list below, and is 'Environmental Samples' - number 11 - to reflect the provenance of our sample and unlike many other Stramenopiles in NCBI which are listed as '4' - Plants and Fungi. :/ 

This will show the output:

    Your calculated TaxID = 3304349. Please use this with makeblastdb and your fasta sequences.
    Backing up orginal names.dmp
    Appending new line
    Done.
    Backing up orginal nodes.dmp
    Appending new line
    Finished.
Remember your new TaxID of '3304349', this is the ID you will need to use with *makeblastdb*.

At the end of the names.dmp file, you will now have a new record:

    3304349	|	MAST-4A	|		|	scientific name	|
Along with the corresponding record in nodes.dmp
    
    3304349	|	1735725	|	species	|		|	11	|	1	|	1	|	1	|	1	|	1	|	1	|	1	|
The original nodes.dmp and names.dmp have been backed up in the same location as nodes_backup.dmp and names_backup.dmp.

### New Group
This is done much in the same way, but you will have to add the different lineage levels one-by-one in order to build the taxonomic relationships. However, we don't want the TaxID to keep on incrementing by 10^length-1, so we can use the -override variable to supply the script with the previous TaxID and it will increment it by 1. Add the 'lowest' rank of your new lineage first, e.g. kingdom before class and then finally genus and species.

# More Information 
## Structure of \*.dmp files
As per NCBI's taxdump_readme.txt:
Each of the files store one record in the single line that are delimited by "\t|\n" (tab, vertical bar, and newline) characters. Each record consists of one or more fields delimited by "\t|\t" (tab, vertical bar, and tab) characters. The brief description of field position and meaning for each file follows.

## nodes.dmp
This file represents taxonomy nodes. The description for each node includes the following fields:

	tax_id					-- node id in GenBank taxonomy database
 	parent tax_id				-- parent node id in GenBank taxonomy database
 	rank					-- rank of this node (superkingdom, kingdom, ...) 
 	embl code				-- locus-name prefix; not unique
 	division id				-- see division.dmp file
 	inherited div flag  (1 or 0)		-- 1 if node inherits division from parent
 	genetic code id				-- see gencode.dmp file
 	inherited GC  flag  (1 or 0)		-- 1 if node inherits genetic code from parent
 	mitochondrial genetic code id		-- see gencode.dmp file
 	inherited MGC flag  (1 or 0)		-- 1 if node inherits mitochondrial gencode from parent
 	GenBank hidden flag (1 or 0)            -- 1 if name is suppressed in GenBank entry lineage
 	hidden subtree root flag (1 or 0)       -- 1 if this subtree has no sequence data yet
 	comments				-- free-text comments and citations

## names.dmp
Taxonomy names file has these fields:

	tax_id					-- the id of node associated with this name
	name_txt				-- name itself
	unique name				-- the unique variant of this name if name not unique
	name class				-- (synonym, common name, ...)
